      The COVID-19 pandemic changed routines in regard to learning and teaching. How did those changes impact grade distributions?

  </header>

  
    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>After seeing some of the racing bar charts that a user named Magnar created for Overwatch League data, I’ve been thinking about where I could possibly use that kind of visualization. Then after a conversation with a friend about trends in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game">gacha games</a>, I thought of something that could be really interesting:</p>

<p>So first and foremost - what the heck is Honkai Impact 3? Put simply, it’s a gacha game that takes hack and slash combat as its main gameplay element. I think this kind of example video does a good job of representing the vibe of the gameplay.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzXeYsG2vM">
</iframe>

<p>(It’s very worth noting: Honkai Impact 3 is actually made by the same company as the <em>huuugely</em> popular Genshin Impact. In fact, if you know the two games, it’s pretty clear Genshin’s combat system is pretty well informed by Honkai’s. They both are hack-and-slash-y, with dodging, basic attacking, a single basic ability and a single energy-recharging ultimate ability unique to each character, etc.)</p>

<p>Since again, this game isn’t that familiar to most people, I’ll go over some of the basic terms relevant to our analysis.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Honkai Impact 3</strong>: Also abbreviated “HI3”. According to the wiki:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Honkai Impact 3rd is a “gacha” style game that allows players to obtain items both through gameplay and through the usage of its in-game currency called “Crystals,” which can be earned or bought with real money. Honkai Impact 3rd’s gameplay takes a lot of hints from popular action RPG series like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta. Players can string together various well-timed combos as well as activate powerful effects when dodging attacks with precision.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Valkyrie</strong>: League of Legends is to Champions, Overwatch is to Heroes, Valorant is to Agents, then Honkai Impact 3 is to Valkyries. What I’m saying is that these are just the names of each different “character” you can use in the game. (Though you might look at the visualization and say “wait, I see the same character many times, just in a different costume. And yeah, in the lore they’re the same character, but for all intents and purposes here, they have different kits and different mechanics so they’re characters).</li>
</ul>

<p>&lt;!– Here’s a list of the ones we’ll be examining.</p>

<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>6S: <a href="https://honkaiimpact3.fandom.com/wiki/Sixth_Serenade">Sixth Serenade</a> –&gt;</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Abyss</strong>: The <a href="https://honkaiimpact3.fandom.com/wiki/Infinity_Abyss">Infinite Abyss</a>, refers to sort of “ranked” play system in a gacha game. If you’re not familiar with gacha games and are thinking “wait, how does ranked play work in a hack and slash game?”, it basically just works like this: you have a certain amount of time to make your way through as many floors as possible. Players were divided into brackets (like League of Legends), and the top 5 players get to advance to the next Abyss tier, 12 stay, and 3 are demoted.<sup id="fnref:PGR" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:PGR" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Temperature</strong>: This refers to a mechanic in the Abyss meant to curb progress if you were too weak. In particular, it causes you to take damage over time (like a burn effect), with higher temperature meaning higher damage. Importantly, the longer you take to complete a floor, the higher the temperature rise. Essentially, even if you could “cheese” a floor by constantly running away, you’d eventually just die so you can’t just progress indefinitely. <strong>This also rewards and incentivizes players to beat floors as quickly as possible.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>And so without further ado, here’s the visualization:</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-bar-chart-race" data-src="visualisation/6874204">
  <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
</div>

<p>Tada. I think this was quite a bit of fun to make, and there’s something satisfying about these “racing” bar charts, particularly ones like these where there are both lots of new entries that shoot their way to the top as well as old entries that somehow find their way back in the top 10. We’ll go over those detail later of course.</p>

<p>But as for how we’re going to break down this visualization, I figured we can just do the simplest thing possible: I’ll just freeze-frame on some key times and give some context as to what was happening at that point in the game. I think this will be especially helpful for most people, especially since Honkai Impact isn’t exact the most well known or widespread game out these (especially compared to it’s big big big brother, Genshin Impact).</p>

<p>Note: I might turn this into a video someday so I can actually show off some of these builds/strategies in the margins. Might take a while though.</p>

<p><strong>October 2016</strong>: The game’s release. Most normal players quickly found Bladestrike (VB) to be the best for going into Abyss. (Oh man Bladestrike. Talk about a throwback. My first S-rank Battlesuit). But as is standard in any gacha game, the whales were the first to find the best comps, and they showed off their shiny LE + KMB + DB teams.</p>

<p>Also, you might want to keep in the back of your mind that we’re starting off in the 5 digit range here. Keep that in mind by the end of the line.</p>

<p><strong>March 2017</strong>: Himeko’s release, the first new character, with her first battlesuit Blood Rose. The power creep already sort of starts here as people quickly find her to be very strong indeed. Over time though, people discovered that a paralyze build with Knight Moonbeam could have insane burst and therefore clear time.</p>

<p><strong>May 2017</strong>: This is when the temperature mechanic I mentioned above was added to Abyss which means that most of what I said previously worked is now ded. (RIP Bladestrike and LE, people’s most common first S-ranks. :( You can see them just continuously dropping at this point) Also Yae Sakura’s release with here Goushinnso <em>Meme</em>nto suit. She would continue to top DPS charts for like a good half year.</p>

<p>For players without Meme though, an interesting development at this time was a glitch found with Yamabuki (YA) where you could fire her held laser infinitely with her ult (I didn’t have YA at the time, so I don’t really know how the glitch works). Combined with YA’s great utility in her heal and DEF down, this was really helpful as YA was just an A-rank suit so strats with her were way more accessible.</p>

<p><strong>August 2017</strong>: Theresa’s release and her weapon Oath of Judah. This weapon is good enough to warrant its own slot here. It was a great alternative to Meme for bosses. Theresa’s first battlesuit, Violet Executer (VE), was a really good physical DPS, almost competing with Memento if you paired her with Mjolnir for lots of DEF down and DB to extend her bleeds.</p>

<p><strong>October 2017</strong>: An important month, the release of Celestial Hymn (CH), who buffs physical DPS. This helped physical teams like with VE and Snowy Sniper (SS) overtake Meme after her 6-month reign, and eventually she was just relegated to a boss-killer position as people climbed to higher temperatures.</p>

<p>This was also the release of Memorial Arena, a more boss-fighting oriented “endgame” piece of content. This is why we see Judah and some other valkyries who haven’t had more of a chance to shine rising here.</p>

<p><strong>January 2018</strong>: Eventually after some stabilization, people settled on the team of SS + DB + CH. At some point, people discovered that as temperature kept rising, VE was more effective as her passive could reduce bleed.</p>

<p><strong>May 2018</strong>: For those who remember way back, this is when Abyss was reworked so that bleed would increase with time, the defensive meta was over. At this point, temperatures weren’t that high, so people could use 2 different DPS and 1 gatherer to quickly take out mobs. Night Squire, focusing on single target damage, could one-shot bosses.</p>

<p><strong>August 2018</strong>: When I started seriously getting into the game - the release of the first Herrscher: Herrscher of the Void (HV). There’s a point in many gacha games when there’s a character that’s so OP you basically have to pull for them if you don’t want to get the “FOMO”, and this was her. Her DPS was on another level if you were able to equip her properly, and even more than that, she was just a heck of a lot of fun to use.</p>

<p><strong>November 2018</strong>: If you’re not familiar, just as a funny display of how strong HotV was,  this was when the Dirac Sea event released with specific “weather” events to try to get you to play with certain kinds of valkyries, but nope. Most people could easily destroy even the Mech-type weathers with HotV.</p>

<p><strong>December 2018</strong>: The overall difficulty of Dirac Sea was reduced to allow for other valks to shine as well. Phoenix was also released here, and became quite a sleeper hit as she was also really fun to use as a flex pick.</p>

<p><strong>March 2019</strong>: Version 3.0 was released around this time, and with it came Drive Kometa. She <em>really</em> helped melee valks with the impairment from her autos (reduced interrupt resist). So now there were other solutions that “just throw HotV at it”.</p>

<p><strong>June 2019</strong>: In addition, the Q Singularis event was around this time, and lots of the enemies it brought made HotV very sad:</p>

<p><strong>July 2019</strong>: HotV’s reign was finally brought to an end with the next Herrscher: Herrscher of Reason (VALKYRIES ON MOTORCYCLESSSSS). She was so good that while previous you basically needed Judas, people were using here to take down that RPC drone thingy in Arena in like 1 second.</p>

<p>In fact, this is where things start getting a little out of hand. HoR allowed people to get 1 second kills with even just A-ranks like BB. Once the 1 second kills became 0 second kills, Mihoyo released the next expansion of the Abyss system: Exalted.</p>

<p>Just as a side note, you might be noticing a bit of a pattery with the Herrschers here, in that the bar chart has to entirely shift just to fit their own bar when they release. They’re that strong.</p>

<p>Mihoyo kind of has a track record now with these “god” characters, in particular, the Herrschers from HI3 and Archons from Genshin. I suppose they’ve found this kind of strategy to work well, having “godlike” characters in their stories lets them have these. I haven’t done too much digging (anime game lore makes my head sad), but I think there’s some actually solid-sounding theories out there about how Genshin and Honkai are in the same universe. So maybe this idea isn’t too crazy after all.</p>

<p><strong>September 2019</strong>: The age of old valkyries rising from the dead. PRI-arm was released here, basically just think of it as 6 star weapons that are exponentially more powerful. Basically must haves. All the veterans can rejoice that LE and Meme were back to see the light of day again.</p>

<p><strong>October 2019</strong>: Another meta shakeup with the release of Hawk of the Fog (HF) and Stygian Nymph (SN). HF especially, it was one of those funny situations where nobody batted an eye until someone came up with a great strategy (in this case it was to use Zhangheng B) and then she literally became the best valk.</p>

<p>A lot of the arena bosses at this point were quantum to encourage people to use SN, but people realized that using Seele’s other suit, Swallowtail Phantasm (SP), paired with the new 11th PRI, allowed for some <em>crazy</em> damage.</p>

<p><strong>November 2019</strong>: The meta once again sort of stabilized itself with SP taking care of multi-enemy bosses, and Nuada’s PRI form releasing meant that HF was once again crazy good for all other bosses.</p>

<p><strong>January 2020</strong>: The release of Azure Empyrea (AE) for Fu Hua meant elemental teams were on the rise again. In particular Vermillion Knight (VK) could absolutely melt bosses now as well and rose very high in the rankings.</p>

<p><strong>April 2020</strong>: The release of Bright Knight Excelsis (BKE). Kind of underwhelming for a new S-rank, but…</p>

<p><strong>May 2020</strong>: Mihoyo turned things around with the release of Starlit Astrologos. Also, on another note, Twilight Paladin (TP) was also an interesting pick at this time, but struggled on bosses like Jizo who showed up quite a bit.</p>

<p><strong>July 2020</strong>: Another Herrscher release, this time Herrscher of Thunder (HoT) for Mei. Basically a straight upgrade to HF. With Mech types being common, people using HF would have a hard time keeping up if they came across bosses like Hephaestus.</p>

<p><strong>August 2020</strong>: Version 4.2, Release of Superstring Abyss. Didn’t do much to shake up the meta, but honestly I just remembered it was really hard :(</p>

<p><strong>September 2020</strong>: Version 4.3, release of Fervent Tempo (FT), who together with Ana’s debut in 4.2 with Argent Knight (AK) made also actually revived HoR as a more cost-effective option.</p>

<p><strong>February 2021</strong>: Finally, the release of the most recent Herrscher: Herrscher of Sentience (HoS) for Fu Hua. Again, she dominated Abyss and could melt bosses as well. The ones she couldn’t, she could just be used as physical support.</p>

<p>Hope that was a fun trip down memory lane. Honestly I’ve spend like a couple nights now just browsing old Youtube and Bilibili videos to gather data, and there was just so much nostalgia thinking about suits like Celestial or Meme again. Nowadays I’m not playing too much anynow (too pay to win IMO), but I realized just how much variety there really was in the different valks that were popular. I hope you had as much fun/nostalgia walking through all this as I did!</p>

      <p>If you’re familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishing:_Gray_Raven">Punishing Gray Raven</a> (PGR), which released a global version very recently, the Warzone system is pretty similar. Not very surprising I guess given how similar the games are. <a href="#fnref:PGR" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

  <p>Michael is an Applied Math student at UCLA, but also minoring in Statistics and Asian Languages, with a specialization in computing - just studying anything that seems fun to me. Hoping that one day he’ll able to apply all the math+programming he’s been enjoying working on to help people solve their real-world problems. But most importantly? “I can only use SpeedChat”.</p>
