      The COVID-19 pandemic changed routines in regard to learning and teaching. How did those changes impact grade distributions?

    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>It’s no secret that school feels different when we are attending the UZLA, University of Zoom Los Angeles. From being able to wake up late, attending class in pajamas, and 24 hour exams, I’m finding many elements a lot easier.</p>

<p>However, with return to campus on the horizon, many people have been been dreading the additional return to in person exams. I’ve discussed with my friends and other peers at UCLA, and the common consensus is that classes have been getting easier online, at least in STEM, mainly thanks to 24 hour open-note exams.</p>

<p>But of course as, uhh, <em>quantitatively-minded folks</em>, we had to start asking the question: is there any way to actually quantify this. Like, can we get our hands on actual data to see if say there were x% more A’s or B’s this year compared to last? Are some subjects “faring” better than others? You know, standard questions you’d ask of a normal dataset.</p>

<p>In pursuit of answering those questions, I’m going to present == a little bit of a sequel to my past adventures in exploring UCLA’s enrollment numbers, parallel to that of course is getting another piece of information regarding classes: the grade distributions.</p>

<p>How can we get this data though, aren’t people usually opposed to talking about their grades? But if you’re a UCLA student, when I said “grade distributions” you probably immediately knew the answer: the renowned <a href="https://bruinwalk.com/">Brunwalk website</a>. Other than just the reviews, it can also display grade distributions (what proportion of the class got an A+, B, etc.), a feature that many find even more informative in their class decisions that just the reviews.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog/grades_files/j4_distribution.PNG" alt="Japanese 4 Fall 2020 Grade Distribution" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog/grades_files/j4_distribution_2019.PNG" alt="Japanese 4 Fall 2019 Grade Distribution" /></p>

<p>For example, it’s pretty clear that this Japanese class offered in Fall quarters had a <em>lot</em> more lenient grading when things went online, with 70% of the class earning an A of some kind in 2020, whereas that number was more around 33% in 2019. Having actually taken this class in 2020 online, I know for sure that it would have been <em>so</em> easy to cheat, given that many vocab and grammar points could be easily looked up and copied.</p>

<p>I was need to scroll through some of my classes in both Japanese and math, but what about a more systematic way to do this? Would it be possible to look by subject or department?</p>

<p>In order to answer this question, I spend the last week or so reverse engineering Bruinwalk’s method of getting this grade data from the registrar to gather all the data neatly. These are the findings from my analysis of that data.</p>

<h3 id="comparing-course-grade-distributions-from-in-person-and-online-learning">Comparing Course Grade Distributions from In-Person and Online Learning</h3>

<p>Just like my enrollment fillup discussion before, let’s start with a fun little interactive tool that can answer the first and foremost question: how are grade distributions different between an in-person period and an online period? This dropdown will allow you to choose a class that was offered identically in both Fall 2019 (in person) and Fall 2020 (online), and it’ll display side-by-side bars of the grade distributions for those two periods.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><select id="dropdown-menu"></select></p>

<div class="main_graph">
  <canvas id="main-chart"></canvas>
  <p class="caption"> In-person grade data is from Fall 2019. Online grade data is from Fall 2020. Classes with only one grade distribution shown were only offered for one of the quarters.</p> 
</div>

<p>On the whole though, here’s the key takeaway: according to all these grade distributions, 29% more A’s were given across all classes in 2020 compared to 2019. An A grade was also the most common grade for both Fall 2019 (35% of all letter grades) and Fall 2020 (45% of all letter grades). When combined, all A grades (A-, A and A+) increased 21% from Fall 2019 to Fall 2020. However, the change in the number of passing grades (C- and higher) was relatively small. In Fall 2019, 97.8% of grades were passing compared to 98.7% in Fall 2020.</p>

<p>Therefore, it’s looking like people who already were doing fine are only getting “shifted up” in the gradings, and this makes sense to a certain extent. If people were already failing classes (getting D’s, F’s), .</p>

<p>The best way to sum this up is that most people (especially people who are already getting passing grades) are just having their grades shifted up (most of the blue distributions tend to be shifted to the left compared to the yellow ones). Indeed, this is clearly consistent with the feeling most people have been having. People who were already doing well academically probably try to keep their grades up as much as possible, so they are likely to take much advantage of UZLA features, like taking way more than 1 hour on 24 hour midterm or rewatching recorded lectures.</p>

<p>Other than structural changes that made classes easier, even just anecdotally I know many professors who were much more lenient with deadlines and second chances during the pandemic. In my Japanese class when people just needed one more minute after the quiz time closed, or math professors who basically just said “yeah, as long as you turn in homework by the end of the quarter, I’ll take it”, these factors might have played an even larger part of overall grade increases we’re seeing.</p>

<h3 id="classes-with-the-greatest-change-in-grade-distribution">Classes With the Greatest Change in Grade Distribution</h3>

<p>Looking up your own class is cool, but which are the exact classes that had the biggest change in grade distribution? Would this give us any insight into which particular kinds of classes might be adapting differently to Zooming?</p>

<p>It’s worth talking a bit more about methodology here because this will be a little different from the previous section where we compared grade distributions directly. Here, we need some way of aggregating the grade change in a single number in order to compare among classes. The “aggregation” function I ended up going with was what I thought was the simplest and most intuitive: I “averaged” the grades simply by calculating the approximate “grade point average” of everyone in the class. In other words, I just took the average grade in the distribution, weighted of course by <a href="https://catalog.registrar.ucla.edu/Policies-and-Regulations/Academic-Policies/Grades">UCLA’s grade point system</a> (A = 4, B = 3, and to the shagrin of so many, A- = 3.7 != 4, etc).</p>

<p>(Also compared to last section, I got data for both Summer 2019+2020, and Fall 2019+2020. Feel free to look at both charts by selecting from the dropdown. BTW, I think comparing Winter/Spring 2020+2021 wouldn’t work because the 2020 sections of Winter and Spring fall into the Online Period).</p>

<p class="caption"> The letter grade data for each course was converted into the 4.0 GPA scale, and the average was computed for each course. Grade change was calculated using the difference between one in-person and one remote quarter.</p>

<p>Of course, we again see another measure consistent with the instinct that grades are becoming more inflated now: when comparing the In-Person Period and the Online Period, there were significantly more classes that had an <em>increase</em> in the class average than classes that had a decrease. Specifically, as for Summer, of the 727 classes I found that had the same professor, <strong>87% saw an increase in class average</strong>, and only 13% had either no change or a decrease. Similarly in Fall, our of 922 classes, around <strong>70% saw an increase in class average</strong>, and only around 10% saw little change.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a step back for a second, I’d like to contextualize a little first. This is a good skill I learned from Warner, you really do have to compare a trend to a “control”. If a movie’s revenue drops drastically in the 3rd week after its release, you have to ask “is that normal compared to other releases?”. In a similar vein here, how much do grades change even in a normal year? Should we expect this many classes to have an increase? I mean, people of course really hype up the effect of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomlindsay/2019/03/30/the-other-college-scandal-grade-inflation-has-turned-transcripts-into-monopoly-money/?sh=5aef4b5b4182">grade inflation</a> on higher education today?</p>

<p>So let’s get a bit of a control comparison here, just to really see if we should expect this kind of increase, or if 2020 really was extra-ordinary. For this, I compared across two “normal” periods, Fall 2018 and Fall 2019. Indeed, from that data, <strong>80% of classes actually had around the same grade average</strong>, and only 12% of classes saw an increase. In other words, class grade distributions tend to not move very much at all during in-person quarters. On the whole, students’ performance probably doesn’t change too much between normal quarters, and professors probably don’t see much need to change their grading systems.</p>

<p>So let’s think back to that stat for online learning though: between Summer 2019 and 2020, <strong>87% saw an increase in class average</strong>. Wow. That’s almost hard to wrap my mind around - a vast majority of classes just getting “strictly” easier, even though it’s the same class and same professor? I’m going to be a bit real here, this is the first time I’ve really felt like something’s really unfair in my educational experience so far. Especially since GPA is so important to those looking to go to grad school, I’d feel <em>so</em> cheated if I went to UCLA just 2 years earlier and then saw people get such good grades.</p>

<p>And honestly, the only reason there probably isn’t more outrage? People just don’t talk much about grades. No one’s going around bragging that “oh yeah, since it’s so easy to just look up test answers/check with calculators now, I’m just aceing all my classes!”. It’s a selection bias sort of thing - the only stories we’re hearing are about those who are struggling to adjust to online learning, which draws attention away from the trend we see in the statistics. The vast majority of students are benefiting from this system, and choose to stay quiet.</p>

<h3 id="grade-distribution-for-different-types-of-classes">Grade Distribution for Different Types of Classes</h3>

<p>There’s also a bit to be said about when you break this trend into different types of classes (lower division, upper division, graduate-level). From what I’ve learned at Warner, this kind of analysis is what you’d call seeing which classes are “driving” this increase.</p>

<p>Of the 727 classes that experienced an increase in grade average between the summer quarters 42% were lower division courses, 53% were upper division courses, and 5% were graduate-level courses. In this same period, classes that experienced a decrease in grade average, around 25% were lower division courses, 60% were upper division courses and 15% were graduate-level courses.</p>

<p>Of the 20 classes that experienced the greatest grade average increase between the fall quarters, around 40% were lower division courses and 60% were upper division courses. In this same period, of the 20 classes that experienced the greatest decrease in grade average, 15% were lower division courses, 45% were upper division courses and 40% were graduate-level courses.</p>

<p>The first point I’d like to make here: it’s clear that upper division classes are having greatest increase in class average. Why is this? I suspect that this has a good amount to do with class size. While both lower division and upper division classes tend to have the same policies as far as exams go, earlier, I was talking about professors tend to give more second chances and policy relaxations during Zoom University. However, it seems that this “relaxation” occurs more in upper division classes than lower division ones. Anecdotally, this makes sense - lower division classes tend to actually if anything be a bit <em>more</em> formal and structured. When you have a Calculus 1 class with like 150 students, you really do need a bit more structure, and you’re probably less likely as a professor to grant homework extensions. It’s be really unfair to say “yeah, turn in all 10 of your homeworks whenever you like” and then handing 10 x 150 homeworks all coming in during Week 10 to your Teaching Assistants.</p>

<p>Just as interesting is the fact upper division courses again made up a plurality of courses that saw a decrease in grade average. Again, just speaking anecdotally, many professors in the math department have actually completely cranked up the difficuly of exams exactly because of the whole 24 hour exam recommendations, probably feeling like they’re not really “getting students to learn” if they let them get away with their normal exams just with internet access.</p>

<p>Another difference to highlight here is in the comparison between summer and fall. In particular, why are there so few graduate course grade changes in summer compared to fall? I think this is just a bit easier to explain: very few graduate students take summer classes. Indeed, in any given summer quarter, at least for the math department, there seem to be only around 1-2 graduate classes offered. Graduate school tends to be a bit more like professional work, so grad students tend to treat classes like and actual job. This means the times they take classes is a bit more regimented, and since graduate degrees often need way fewer required classes (around 10 compared to around 30 for undergraduate degrees if you combine lower division, upper division, and General Education classes).</p>

<h3 id="changes-in-grading-basis-passno-pass-vs-letter-grade">Changes in Grading Basis (Pass/No Pass vs. Letter Grade)</h3>

<p>One final piece of this dataset pie we can dig into doesn’t actually have to do with the grade distributions per se (how many A’s, B’s, etc.). In addition to that, this data actually contains information on the percentage of students who got grades like Pass/No Pass. In case you’re not familiar, UCLA (and I bet many other schools) have a system called Pass/No Pass, or P/NP, where instead of recieving a letter grade (A,B, etc.), you can choose to only get a P or an NP on a transcript. Think of this as the equivalent of “hiding” your grade on a transcript, basically just revealing if you passed the class or not.</p>

<p>Since students have the option to switch between these “grading bases” (Letter Grading vs P/NP), this is meant to be sort of a “desperation fallback” option for people in case they find that a class (or their quarter as a whole) ends up being harder or more stressful than they expected. However, there are a couple important caveats to this system.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Taking a class P/NP forfeits your opportunity to earn grade points for the class. This means that if you end up doing well and you would have gotten an A, your overall GPA still won’t rise.</li>
  <li>This often looks a little sus to graduate schools. Do they really want to admit someone who has historcally “ran away” from a class and wants to hide their grade? Especially in the case</li>
  <li>if that class is a class counting towards your major, you probably don’t even have the option to take P/NP during a normal quarter. For example, <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/ugrad/Majors,%20Minors%20&amp;%20Spec/pdf/Applied%20Math%20Page.pdf">the UCLA applied math major requirements</a> clearly state that “all required courses for the major must be […] taken for a letter grade”.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, something really interesting changed for point 3 in Spring 2020, the first fully online quarter at UCLA. The Academic Senate (big wigs who decide how grades and stuff are administrated at UCLA) <a href="https://covid-19.ucla.edu/update-on-spring-quarter-grading/">voted to allow departments to take major courses for P/NP</a>. This follows in the trend of so many other major US universities (<a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2020/07/30/faculty-senate-discusses-grading-policy/">Stanford</a>, <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/03/harvard-college-adopts-temporary-grading-policy-for-spring-term/">Harvard</a>, <a href="https://yalecollege.yale.edu/policies-procedures/covid-19-faq/covid-19-announcements-and-faqs-archive#AcademicMatters-1">Yale</a>) taking the more universal stance of just straight up allowing or even forcing P/NP for everyone in any major. In addition to this, the they extended the deadline before which students can decide to switch their grading basis from Week Six to Week 10 (essentially right before final exams), allowing much more flexibility for people to choose if they wanted.</p>

<p>This brings us to the final major question I had about UCLA’s academic trends during the pandemic: how many people took advantage of these new P/NP policies? Are we seeing a lot more?</p>

<section id="pie-charts">
  <div><canvas id="before-covid-pie-chart" width="400" height="300"></canvas></div>
  <div><canvas id="after-covid-pie-chart" width="400" height="300"></canvas></div>
</section>
<p class="caption">Each pie chart shows the percentage breakdown of all student grades by grading basis selection (letter grade or pass/no pass).</p>

<p>First and foremost, it’s clear that most people are still deciding to still get letter grades. Maybe this is partially because grades are being boosted in the online environment anyway so people don’t as much need to “hide” their grades. Maybe it’s that second point still in effect from the prior discussion, where peopl. For whatever reason though, online learning hasn’t really made a huge paradigm shift in grading basis overall.</p>

<p>Where it is shifting the needle though is the proportion of students who indeed took classes for Pass/No Pass. In particular, while around 5% of students took classes P/NP in an in-person quarter, this number shifted to 7.5% in Fall 2020! In other words, the proportion of P/NP grades given was 56% higher in an online quarter compared to the in-person equivalent.</p>

<p>And given the prior discussion, of course people are taking advantage of this. Pass/No Pass during a pandemic where you’ve returned home and there might be so much stress trying to adapt to a new environment, and then put hard work into your studies while still getting used to things, it’s not easy for anyone. And as for the whole “grad schools look down on it”, I think there was a realization among students that this wouldn’t matter as much during this time - since so many other schools were allowing or even forcing P/NP grading, most grad schools probably don’t even really care if they see P/NP on a transcript during 2020/2021. In fact, most are doing something pretty neat for our transcripts - they’re putting a small disclaimer about P/NP grading so that admissions people remember that if they do see a P/NP.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog/grades_files/transcipts.PNG" alt="P/NP Disclaimer on my transcript" /></p>

<p>And to be honest, P/NP grading, <em>especially</em> during that first online quarter in my own humble opinion, should have been made even more widely available. For whatever reason, UCLA’s math department <em>still</em> doesn’t allow P/NP for major classes. But when we have this pandemic that’s affecting literally everyone when we move online, and by such dispropotionate amounts (with some still not even having very good internet access, the only thing that can really get you your grade), having P/NP is the only real way to have good equitable grading for everyone.</p>

<p>Anyway, small rant over.</p>

<h3 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h3>

<p>Even with Delta running amok, the train seems to already be moving too fast to brake - UCLA will be in-person for this Fall 2022. This raises the big question though: how well will people return to more traditional in-person exams and lectures? Will people be so used relying on recorded lectures that their note-taking becomes worse, or will people be so used to 24 hour exams that everyone will bomb 1 hour midterms where you actually have to work quickly?</p>

<p>Furthermore, it’s still all quiet on the Western Front on the Academic Senate’s side of things, not stating anything about the P/NP adjustments (which I think we can safely interpret to mean that the P/NP will also go back to normal).</p>

<p>With both of those being said, I think we can make a pretty interesting prediction for what these policies will look like going forward: it’ll be left up to individual professors. In other words, professors can be as harsh or as gentle with the transition back to in-person classes as they desire. I’ve talked to some professors who say they actually much more enjoy this kind of take-home exam, saying that it allows them to ask for higher quality work rather than just quick regurgitation on the spot. I’ve also even seen many cling to 1 hour exams, saying that cheating is too easy when exams are take-home. When we go back in person, I’m sure that some professors will jump at that chance to get back to standard exams, whereas others will give people a bit more time to transition back.</p>

<p>I honestly think the most interesting trend that might arise from all of this is even more “professor selection bias”, the term I just made up on the spot to describe how certain professors become a lot more popular just due to hearsay like from Bruinwalk. In particular, I predict this division between professors I mentioned with only serve to exaggerate the difference betwene “mean” and “nice” professors, and that those professors who are a lot more gentle will become even more popular than they already are.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Either way, this dataset has been a ton of fun to pick apart. There’s something that keeps drawing me back to UCLA’s data. I suppose when I got “skin in the game”, I tend to have a lot more to say.</p>

<p>If you want access to this data, just <a href="mailto:michaelting314@gmail.com">email me</a>! I’d love to hear what other people want to do with this data.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>In order to control for similarity in this comparison, I only allowed the bar chart to show the side-by-side bars when the class was not only offered in both quarters, but also by the same exact professor. Any UCLA student (heck, any college student in general) will tell you that grades can vary widely between different professors, so we should make sure we control for that. You might think this is pretty restrictive, but there are a lot of classes at UCLA - there were over 700 pairs that still satisfied these matching criteria. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
