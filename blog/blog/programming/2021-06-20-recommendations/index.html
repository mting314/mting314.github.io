</ul>

<p>This actually stemmed from a project for my Math 156 (Machine Learning) class here. As I mentioned in my reflection blog post for that quarter, that project focused a lot more on the math, but I thought there could it would be good experience in actually trying to make an interactive web app. After all, what good are personalized recommendations if people can’t get their own?</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<h3 id="the-machine-learning">The Machine Learning</h3>

<p>First thing’s first, the main algorithm I used to generate the recommendations was Alternating Least Squares. Luckily, the math is actually surprisingly simple - I know a lot of those details are deep and can be boring though so I’ll make a notebook-style blog post where I’ll set up a manual version and walk through it.</p>

<p>But as the name suggests, the idea will eventually come down to a big matrix $R$ where each row represents a user, and each column is the rating for a single item (a single show in our case). We “complete” this matrix (get predicted ratings) by factoring into $R \approx X^TY$ where $R$ has a huge dimension (contains all ratings), but each column of $X$ and $Y$ only has a small number of entries that basically represent simplifying each user and item.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="the-non-machine-learning">The Non-Machine Learning</h3>

<p>Even though I of course have been having difficulty really studying and becoming well-versed in machine learning, this actually ended up being the hardest part of the project. But the fact that this is even seeing the light of day means that this was actually the part I really enjoyed. And if you’ve read previous blog posts (in particular, the Moodspace one), this should really come as no surprise. This project presented even bigger challenges in how to architect and orchestrate all the communication between the different parts.</p>

<p>The main application was Flask, quickly proving to be one of my favorite tools, which again I suppose should come as no surprise as the main purpose of web applications is of course to have a dialogue between the code and the frontend, which I have always liked thinking about designing.</p>

<p>Howerver, even if I knew a good amount of the machine learning algorithm I was using, like about the math and its advantages and disadvantages, there was still of course the more technical problem of actually deploying it. Unfortunately the way machine learning is taught at UCLA is much more for these exploratory or one-off analyses, but when it comes to making actual production-level webapps, we didn’t learn many resources 
for “deploying” machine learning. Of course it’s easy enough to do some analysis in a Google Colab, but it’s not quite obvious what to do when you want to make a website that does machine learning.</p>

<p>So at the advise of a grad friend who has lots of experience in Big Data™, I learned about Spark with Databricks. Think of this like AWS Lite specifically for data processing, so it was a lot easier for me to learn. Many of the tools you need but aren’t as important like creating clusters is super simplified, and there’s a really easy UI for simply uploading a file to create a database. But importantly, for our purposes, the main point is being able to create a notebook to wrangle all of your data, and then <em>running that notebook on a schedule</em>. With this in mind, the idea will be to</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with a table of starting recommendations from Kaggle or a datasource living in AWS or Heroku.</li>
  <li>Keep adding to that database as people use the website</li>
  <li>Ever day or so, have Databricks run that Pyspark notebook to get recommendations for every user</li>
  <li>Put those new recommendations into another database</li>
  <li>Serve from that new recommendations database on the website</li>
</ol>

<p>This is probably a really obvious process to the more computer-sciency minded, but this was a whole new paradigm for me, where you sort of separate into “frontend” and “backend” on have two different machines that can talk to each other. Maybe it’s been that I’m so used to the more notebook style programming in math where you just have every part of your program all in one place.</p>

<p>By the way, that step 3 might sound a bit weird, don’t you want your recommendations right then and there? With AWS tools, it is indeed possible to have the machine learning run recalculations again every single time someone asks for their recommendations? Unfortunately, this becomes quite a bit more complex (what do you do if two people ask one second after each other?). While people have solved problems like this before, a bigger problem for me was simply that I did some calculations and running potentially that often and irregularly would leave a bigger hole in my wallet than a poor student could really handle. I’d rather have the recommendations fire off at regular intervals where I can calculate and estimate the monthly cost.</p>

<p>But either way, I should point out that Spark already has really nice and easy to use machine learning tools that are basically as easy as using sk-learn.  I’ll also prepare a simplified version of the notebook with lots of explanatory text on the GitHub repository.</p>

<p>But enough about how it works - what the heck is it?</p>

<h2 id="the-project">The project</h2>

<p>Ah yes, anime. As an Asian Languages minor, you could get me started on a 2 hour long conversation on how its impacting Western society . And of course, you won’t find many lonely Asian nerds like me that haven’t spent a good amount of time as <strong>w e e b s</strong>.</p>

<p>When discussing anime with fellow, ahem, men of culture, I often find that much of the fun comes from actually getting and giving recommendations. It’s fun to think of series you’ve might’ve not loved, but that you think your friend might like, or getting recommended a series that you end up falling in love with and you have to ask the recommender for more similar shows. It’s both the many varied yet very well defined genres and archetypes within the anime ecosphere, as well as the fact that there are just simply a ton of shows, many of which are niche, so there are often a lot of new ones to discover.</p>

<p>Until the Math 156 project, I didn’t even really think of recommendations as a machine learning task, but after thinking about it for just a second, you quickly realize “oh yeah, Netflix’s interface is basically entirely recommendations”. And as I’ll elaborate on in the ALS explanation notebook, I found the idea of laying out users as rows and each rating as a column in a big matrix quite satisfying, and then your ML task is  basically just completing that matrix.</p>

<p>So as for the website itself, the whole process is really simple yet functional. You just create a simple user account, rate at least 10 shows (the recommendations are really bad if you don’t rate a good amount), and then just wait until the recommendations come in from the scheduling! <a href="https://my-anime-recommendations.herokuapp.com/">Try it out</a>.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>If you’ve heard of Nonnegative Matrix Factoring (NMF) like in the context of finding different topics in a corpus of documents, the idea is of course really similar. The only problem is that we don’t have all the information in our big ratings matrix $R$, so we have to put a bit more thought into how exactly to handle it. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

  <p>Michael is an Applied Math student at UCLA, but also minoring in Statistics and Asian Languages, with a specialization in computing - just studying anything that seems fun to me. Hoping that one day he’ll able to apply all the math+programming he’s been enjoying working on to help people solve their real-world problems. But most importantly? “I can only use SpeedChat”.</p>
