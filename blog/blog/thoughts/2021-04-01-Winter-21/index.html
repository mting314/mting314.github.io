<p>Hi everyone, welcome back to another one of these stream-of-consciousness type blogs where I can ramble and ramble as much as I like about all my classes. Winter has been an interesting quarter, coming of course right in the middle of the pandemic year. Overall this quarter has been… well let’s just say pretty boring. I don’t really have many high-level things to say before jumping into class-by-class discussion, so let’s get into it.</p>

<h2 id="pic-16a-python-with-applications-i">PIC 16A: Python with Applications I</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>In-depth introduction to Python programming language for students who have already taken beginning programming course in strongly typed, compiled language (C++, C, or Fortran). Core Python language constructs, applications, text processing, data visualization, interaction with spreadsheets and SQL databases, and creation of graphical user interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What. A. Class.</p>

<p>But Professor Phil Chodrow is, as my friends have been saying more recently, “built different”.</p>

<p>He is genuinely the first professor I’ve had that I can actually say I look up to, in that he is simply an just an amazing person and contributes so much. Other than his teaching (which of course we’ll get to) he does a ton of research and even as an undergraduate I can already tell he contributes so much to the academic community.</p>

<p>On the teaching end of things, what is there to say really? Let’s just start with the fact that he actually records all lectures for us to watch at our own pace. People call this a “flipped classroom” where you’re supposed to learn all the definite material on your own, and then lecture time is set aside for questions and stuff. However, I believe the common consensus among college students is that this often sucks and is poorly executed, with many not getting proper support when things go wrong.</p>

<p>But Professor Chodrow makes it work. First and foremost, this kind of lecturing actually really makes sense for a programming class. Unlike math or other science classes where these kinds of lectures often leave you behind in the dust when you’re trying to figure out problems yourself, the fact that this is a programming class where you can really easily see inputs and outputs and it’s especially easy to adapt what was said in the lectures to all the exercises really does make it work nicely.</p>

<p>To be honest, another problem that people commonly have with the flipped classroom style is that teachers usually implement this simply because they’re being lazy if we’re being honest, so they have less to do during actually lecture time, especially in giant classes of hundreds of people. Of course, if you know Professor Chodrow at all, you know he’s anything but lazy, especially when it comes to teaching. He sets up entire websites to help people navigate the classes, teaches in response to feedback and how people are doing (how they’re scoring on the quizzes, what questions they have, what people are getting tripped up on during the worksheets).</p>

<p>And just quoting from his website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to PIC16A! I’m Professor Phil Chodrow and I’m grateful that you’re here. Before we dive into the details, I want to lay out some guiding principles for this course:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>I want you to succeed. The purpose of this course is for you to build a set of skills that can support you in your studies, hobbies, and careers. You (yes, you) can learn some cool stuff and get a good grade in this course.</li>
    <li>None of us signed up for this. We are all doing the best we can during a time of catastrophe and intense uncertainty. My main aims in designing this course are to (a) offer you flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and (b) encourage you to support and be supported by your classmates. Python programming is fun, and I hope that this course can be a positive part of your experience during these difficult times.</li>
    <li>Your wellbeing comes first. If your wellbeing or that of a loved one comes into conflict with course obligations, I hope that you will attend to the former. I’ve included a considerable amount of flexibility in this course. It is possible to completely miss roughly two weeks worth of quizzes and assignments without negatively impacting your grade. If you anticipate extended difficulties related to participation or assignments, reach out to me at the earliest opportunity. We’ll make it happen.</li>
    <li>We’ve got your back. As the instructor, I’m available to you through multiple channels. You also have an amazing support team—your TAs, LAs, and peers are all here to help you in your learning journey.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Listen to that! Even if it’s just words on a page, when’s the last time you’ve seen a professor make these kinds of commitments? <em>This</em> in my humble opinion is the right way to start a class like this, and you can already tell just how much he cares about those he teaches.</p>

<p>To be honest, the project was the only component I was a bit iffy on for this class. That whole section on machine learning was in my opinion not very interesting mainly because we were just copy-pasting his example code that was the very standard “tell sklearn to ‘do the thing’”. The project we were given essentially asked us to turn this up to the maximum, where we just had to put together every element of the machine learning we were studying into one big notebook together with our groupmates.</p>

<p>I do still see the value in it though; even if not to build something amazingly cool, I think branding it as a project was smart in that it forced us to come up not only with good results but also practice good communication within the group as well as when we compiled the final report. I remember my and my partner spent a good 3 hours one night just to hammer out the entire project, and it was actually pretty good practice for exactly that.</p>

<p>One more slight complaint that’s just me talking (because I can confidently say that Professor Chodrow is objectively the best teacher I’ve had at UCLA so far): I didn’t really like going to his office hours. I think part of the problem is that I had my expectations set far too high; he seemed so chill, so much like us that I thought it would be easy to talk to him. However, that ended up being exactly the problem: he’s a bit too easy to talk to.</p>

<p>What often happened is that when we got to points where people were just chatting, the conversation often went to career advice general tips on how to be a good student and stuff like that. I’m definitely not saying there’s a problem with that; if anyone’s the right person to talk with about that, it’s indeed Professor Chodrow. However, it made it hard to have a good conversation among everyone because he essentially started preaching, not expecting or even looking like he wanted to make it into a dialogue between the person asking and himself. Again 99% of this is just me, but even when I’m getting advice I usually like it when we can have a conversation because I often just get overwhelmed when people just talk at me; it’s that feeling where you’re hearing something you don’t want to hear but you don’t have a venue through which to voice that dissonance. Maybe it’s just that I do better in  one-on-one scenarios where some of that “dialogue” feeling is recovered. Maybe it’s just me being absolutely terrible at hearing things I don’t like.</p>

<p>Either way, I didn’t want this to end on a bad note, so let me just recapitulate and say: Professor Chodrow is the best professor at UCLA. PIC16A is already basically a must-take for anyone who’s even remotely considering working with data or computational math, and taking it with him will make your experience amazing.</p>

<h2 id="math-114c-computability-theory">Math 114C: Computability Theory</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Effectively calculable, Turing computable, and recursive functions; Church/Turing thesis. Normal form theorem; universal functions; unsolvability and undecidability results. Recursive and recursively enumerable sets; relative recursiveness, polynomial-time computability. Arithmetical hierarchy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the reason I decided to take this class is a bit random. This is completely different from the classes I would normally appreciate, but I decided to take it simply because Professor Arant was teaching it (my professor from 135 and 142 that I really like).</p>

<p>Probably one of the most interesting non-applied math classes I’ve taken at UCLA. Often many more of the pure and abstract math classes (think algebra or combinatorics) start to feel like puzzles or games, and thats where things start to lose me. Like, I can still somewhat appreciate a puzzle-like question every once in a while (otherwise I would absolutely hate the math major), but its something I get bored of very quickly and I can’t imagine making it a career. However, something about these puzzles actually kind of clicked with me this time.</p>

<p>For one, I really appreciate when the “story” of the class is a bit clear. Basically the story is: is there are more mathematical (basically using descriptive set theory) way of talking about “computable” functions? And when I say computable, I mean functions that a computer can do, for example,
<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x) = 2x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathdefault">x</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mord mathdefault">x</span></span></span></span>
a computer can obviously do.</p>
<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We spent time first fleshing out what functions were computable by using different <strong>models of computation</strong>, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_machine">register machines</a>, but that was only the beginning, where things felt more like an algorithms course because the goal was to talk about algorithms like this. However, we took a turn way more in the math direction when we proved that all URM functions are actually <em>recursive</em>.</p>

<p>“Recursive” is basically a more mathematical definition of computable, even if they are indeed equivalent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Definition: The set of recursive functions is the smallest set of functions that includes the constantly-zero function, successor function (just adds one), and projection functions (that extracts one argument from the $n$ inputs), and is furthermore closed under minimalization, substitution</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From there, we started talking about stuff like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursively_enumerable_set">r.e. sets</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_degree">degree theory</a>. If you take a look at any textbook or Wikipedia article on computability theory, you’ll very quickly see that this is much more math/set-theory than anything that looks like a computer science course.</p>

<p>(By the way, you might ask “oh, if we’re talking about if problems are computable/decidable, isn’t that really important, like isn’t it really helpful to know that a certain unsolved problem might not be decidable?”</p>

<p>Yeah, you have a good point, but at least the way we learned about all this stuff, we didn’t actually apply this theory to too many mathematical “problems”, simply because that actually requires a good amount of setup. We did however cover a really neat application to showing that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_tile">Wang tilings</a> are undecidable (there is no algorithm that can determine if you can make a valid tiling given a set of base tiles).</p>

<h2 id="math-118-mathematical-methods-of-data-theory">Math 118: Mathematical Methods of Data Theory</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lecture, three hours; discussion, one hour. Requisites: courses 42, 115A. Introduction to computational methods for data problems with focus on linear algebra and optimization. Matrix and tensor factorization, PageRank, assorted other topics in matrices, linear programming, unconstrained optimization, constrained optimization, integer optimization, dynamic programming, and stochastic optimization. P/NP or letter grading.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m glad this class filled in some of the gaps in the beginning in some linear algebra concepts we didn’t really cover in 115A, like QR factorization and SVD which seem pretty important for data stuff. Later on, we did cover some really interesting data algorithms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization">nonnegative matrix factorization</a></p>

<p>By greatest criticism with this class though is certainly that its still way too theoretical. I really wish some of the homework problems asked us to deal with real world datasets and actually perform some algorithms on them, otherwise everything in the class was really boring and seemed useless. One example of this actually started out pretty neat; there’s something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm">Viterbi algorithm</a> which actually comes from ideas about dynamic programming that lets you make a good guess based on observed events what kind of state you’re in behind the scenes. The best example of this is if you know there if your friend is flipping a coin and there’s a chance between each flip they switch from a fair coin to a loaded coin, and you see a sequence like TTTTTT, then HTHTH, then TTTTTTTT, you should have a pretty good idea what coin they’re using at each section.</p>

<p>However, we only ever used this algorithm on very toy examples, like those coins. I really wish we could have some assignment where we see how to apply to a real dataset, and what the result might look like. Heck, I don’t even really know what kinds of data you could apply this to. That’s definitely something I could research, but doesn’t it make more sense for that to be brought up in the class itself?</p>

<p>And I think this class could really be improved just by adding in some final project for the class, where you have to apply one of the algorithms. That would make learning all of these so much more rewarding, I think.</p>

<h2 id="math-156-machine-learning">Math 156: Machine Learning</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lecture, three hours; discussion, one hour. Requisite: course 115A, 164, 170E (or 170A or Statistics 100A) and Programming in Computing 10A of Computer Science 31. Strongly recommended requisite: Program in Computing 16A or Statistics 21. Introductory course on mathematical models for pattern recognition and machine learning. Topics include parametric and nonparametric probability distributions, curse of dimensionality, correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction, and concepts of decision theory. Advanced machine learning and pattern recognition problems, including data classification and clustering, regression, kernel methods, artificial neural networks, hidden Markov models, and Markov random fields. Projects in MATLAB to be part of final project presented in class. P/NP or letter grading.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With a name like this, taking 156 should be a no brainer for, well, any applied math major. However, my suspiscions near the beginning of the quarter proved to actually be correct; this class didn’t really feel like a machine learning class at all. Heck PIC 16A felt more like one. No, I think if this class were to advertise itself more honestly, you’d have to call it something like <strong>Function Approximation</strong>.</p>

<p>Because at the end of the day, that’s really what the course felt like, trying to find different archetypes of functions and methods to reduce error of fitting some function to some data. If you look at our homework, and even exams, so many questions actually just “compute the derivative of this function I just give you, and prove it looks like this”. There’s a lot of really deep and interesting math that happens in machine learning, no doubt about it, but I think UCLA’s math course on it has a good amount of catching up to do.</p>

<p>The best part though was definitely the project we got to do. I worked with one of my good friends from high school to make a fun little presentation: a recommendation system for anime based on user ratings. On our professor’s recommendation, we referenced a neat paper on an algorithm for this purpose called <a href="https://goldberg.berkeley.edu/pubs/Eigentaste-Info-Retrieval-Journal.pdf">Eigentaste</a> where they came up with a recommendation system for jokes actually, crowdsourcing from a website. Basically the idea is to take a correlation matrix based on all</p>

<p>I really appreciated this project because the topic, anime, was something of particular interest to me and I think a bit more fun than just old joke datasets. I also found it particularly satisfying that the data seemed to fit quite naturally into a mathematical setting, where the data we were examining was basically already a matrix, ready to be manipulated using all of our mathematical tools right out of the gate.</p>

<h2 id="japanese-5-intermediate-modern-japanese-part-2">Japanese 5: Intermediate Modern Japanese (Part 2)</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lecture, three hours; discussion, two hours. Requisite: course 4 with grade of C or better or Japanese placement test. Not open to students who have learned, from whatever source, enough Japanese to qualify for more advanced courses. Continuation of course 4. P/NP or letter grading.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, Japanese has been a highlight of this quarter.</p>

<p>Well I say highlight, but the actual lectures were admittedly quote boring. The course actually had a bit of an interesting journey, with all of us students being at the direct forefront of Menjo-sensei’s experimentation.</p>

<p>The class actually started very similarly to J4, with our professor just going through slides explaining each grammar point from the very famous <a href="https://tobiraweb.9640.jp/">Tobira textbook</a> (once again, this book is usually regarded as the sequel to the Genki 1+2 books after you start). One major difference, though, was the greatly increased number of quizzes: we were to have a vocab quiz <em>every single lecture day</em>. At this point, I think it’s just ridiculous, and I’m really still unsure why the Japanese department feels the need to bombard us with so many quizzes. While I appreciated not having midterms in these foreign language classes, I’m starting to feel like not a full-blown midterm, but maybe a unit test every other week that tested some vocab but also reading comprehension and grammar would be cool, and feel more like learning a language “for real”.</p>

<p>However, after a certain point, Menjo-sensei declared something interesting for the class. All of a sudden, he did away with the fact that we had to do these particle practice worksheets and moved Lesson Content Quizzes (the place where we were actually tested on grammar) to weekdays, rebranding them as Unit Tests. As with many things unfortunately with these classes, the reason for big sudden changes like this were left very mysterious, but I’m guessing someone complained that there were just way too many tests being given outside of normal classtime, which is definitely fair. I indeed also did welcome this change, but I also noticed something a bit different with the quizzes after a certain point: rather than testing us very strongly on the subtleties of how a certain point is used, many of the questions were actually just like “ok, make your own sentence”.</p>

<p>And I know that this idea of having to bring in creativity with the grammar you learn is honestly a better way of learning, something about it kind of just felt… off. Like it didn’t feel like I was really proving I understood the language well and how to comprehend things, it was just testing on how I could substitute the one example sentence he gave for a particualr grammar point with some other nouns/situations.</p>

<p>It’s still definitely worth mentioning though: I really really appreciate Menjo-sensei changing up the class at the feedback of all the students. Even if it doesn’t hit 100% of the time for all of us, he’s one of the best professors I’ve had in terms of really thinking about how he wants to teach us, because he can really tell that we’re all really passionate about learning the language.</p>

<p>Either way though, I’m still overall happy that conversation hours are still not only pretty vibe-y but also really good for general listening practice. I still consider myself really lucky that we found this, and I still feel that our professor is really benefitting from the socialization as well. To be honest, he seemed pretty lonely, living alone in his house, and before our conversation hours, he would just meeting with the Zoom class, which isn’t really socialization. I’m really hoping that this can still continue into Spring.</p>
