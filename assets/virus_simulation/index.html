    <h1>Explanation</h1>

    <p>
        If you want the entire background on my exploration of this model and simulation, you can read my writeup of it,
        or poke around the Github page which has the code for this page as well as a Jupyter notebook that has some more
        neat graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
        TLDR though, this is a simulation of a, uhh, hypothetical infection that spread from China to America that aims
        to explore the question, "how much time does America have to react (by shutting down travel etc.) to the virus
        arriving?"
    </p>
    <p>
        So naturally, we start with an initial infected population in China in blue on the left. Now once the simulation
        starts, you'll start to see those little blue dots multiplying as the virus spreads among people, and that
        growth will also be reflected in the line graph below that tracks the case numbers in real time. (I honestly
        don't know what an appropriate timescale should be for the normal parameters I have set, so let's just say that
        those tick marks represent numbers of weeks.) A little while into the simulation, you might start to see those
        little blue dots fly over from China represented in blue on the left flying over by plane to the US in green on
        the right. While it might look like it, the number of flights is not going to change before travel shuts down,
        we're just tracking the movement of infected people, and if more people in China are infected, more people on
        the flights will be infected as well.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Parameters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Flight rate - how often a plane carrying (potentially infected) passengers travels from China to America.
            You can think of this as the chance a particular person travels from China to America in a certain week.
        </li>
        <li>
            Infection rate - higher this is, faster the infection spreads. You can think of this like how many poeple a
            single carrier infects per week.
        </li>
        <li>
            Quarantine rate - how many people are brought into quarantine (and we're assuming aren't going to infect any
            more people) every week. This is assumed to be constant throughout the whole run.
        </li>
        <li>
            Initial population in China - what it says on the tin.
        </li>
        <li>
            Time to shutdown - how much time (in weeks I guess) after the infection arrives in the US it takes to shut
            down all travel from China.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        One really important part of how this works is what I mean by "overwhelmed". There's a lot more justification as
        to what and why I call it this, but suffice it to say for this simulation, it's when the infected population in
        the US is first non-zero/starts growing. For modeling purposes, this is when I declare that the infection has
        "reached" America (even though of course there were infected people arriving before then), and when the
        countdown clock starts before travel stops.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, due to, for lack of a better word, the discretization of the model (we're modelling individual planes
        at the US at discrete time steps), there are tiny little bumps that represent flights with small amounts of
        infected people that are quarantined quickly.
    </p>
    <a href="https://gyazo.com/c21db57964cd5d71a0c1df201d976ffa"><img
            src="https://i.gyazo.com/c21db57964cd5d71a0c1df201d976ffa.png"
            alt="Little bumps in America's infected population from relatively healthy planes" width="624" /></a>
    <p>
        Therefore, I had to hack in a bit of an annoying check that was just about equivalent to the original check for
        the first non-zero infected population. Instead, I actually check for the <i>first time the infected population
            in the US is non-zero for 10 time steps in a row.</i> I mostly chose 10 just because those little bumps
        lasted around 9 time steps (so just 1 more to confirm that we we're actually getting our feet off the ground)
    </p>

    <p>
        The stopping condition is when there are 100k total infected people across both cities, as a
        way of
        indicating that our assumption that the pool of infected people was a tiny fraction of the total susceptible
        population is starting to become invalid.
    </p>
